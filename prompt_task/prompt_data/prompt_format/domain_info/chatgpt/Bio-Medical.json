Methidiumpropyl-EDTA (MPE) is a fluorescent compound that selectively binds to divalent metal ions when complexed with DNA. When exposed to laser light, the MPE-DNA complex undergoes photodissociation, resulting in cleavage at the metal ion binding sites. This allows for the identification and sequencing of specific DNA regions."

Ect2: Ect2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho family GTPases and plays a crucial role in cytokinesis. Dephosphorylation of Ect2 ensures its activation and promotes Rho activation, which is necessary for contractile ring formation and furrow ingression.\n3. Anillin: Anillin is a protein that regulates actin dynamics and contributes to cytokinesis by forming a scaffold at the cleavage furrow. Its dephosphorylation promotes its proper localization and function during cytokinesis.\n4. Septins: Septins are a group of conserved proteins involved in cytokinesis. Dephosphorylation of septins contributes to their reorganization and assembly into the contractile ring at the cleavage furrow.\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other Cdk targets that are dephosphorylated during cytokinesis."
