    "llama-7b_response": "The statement \"32% of liver transplantation programs required patients to discontinue methadone treatment in 2001\" is not entirely truthful. While it is true that some liver transplantation programs may have required patients to discontinue methadone treatment in 2001, it is not accurate to say that 32% of all liver transplantation programs did so.\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that methadone is a medication used to treat opioid addiction. Liver transplantation is a medical procedure used to treat end-stage liver disease, which can be caused by a variety of factors including viral infections, alcohol abuse, and genetic disorders. Therefore, it is unlikely that liver transplantation programs would routinely require patients to discontinue methadone treatment unless there was a specific medical reason to do so.\n\nSecondly, even if some liver transplantation programs did require patients to discontinue methadone treatment in 2001, it is not accurate to say that this was the case for 32% of programs. The statement implies that this was a widespread practice among liver transplantation programs, which is not supported by the available evidence.\n\nLastly, it is important to note that the statement does not provide any context or information about the reasons why liver transplantation programs may have required patients to discontinue methadone treatment in 2001. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the statement.\n\nIn conclusion, while the statement \"32% of liver transplantation programs required patients to discontinue methadone treatment in 2001\" may contain some elements of truth, it is not entirely accurate and does not provide a complete picture of the situation.",

    "llama-7b_response": "The claim \"7-day-old adult Caenorhabditis elegans exhibit approximately 75% of the learning capacity seen in 1-day old adults\" is not accurate.\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that the claim is referring to the learning capacity of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of nematode worm. These worms are commonly used in scientific research due to their short lifespan, small size, and simple nervous system. However, it is important to keep in mind that the learning capacity of C. elegans may not be directly comparable to that of humans or other animals with more complex nervous systems.\n\nFurthermore, the accuracy of the claim depends on the specific type of learning being measured. C. elegans has been shown to exhibit learning in a variety of contexts, such as in response to environmental stimuli, in response to social cues, and in response to changes in food availability. However, the claim appears to be referring specifically to the learning capacity of C. elegans in a laboratory setting, where they are trained to avoid a particular odor.\n\nIn this context, research has shown that 1-day-old adult C. elegans exhibit significantly better learning than 7-day-old adults. For example, one study found that 1-day-old adults were able to learn to avoid the odorant used in the training task in over 80% of trials, while 7-day-old adults only achieved this level of learning in around 50% of trials.\n\nIn conclusion, while C. elegans has been shown to exhibit learning in a variety of contexts, the claim \"7-day-old adult Caenorhabditis elegans exhibit approximately 75% of the learning capacity seen in 1-day old adults\" is not accurate when referring specifically to the learning capacity of C. elegans in a laboratory setting where they are trained to avoid a particular odor.",

    "llama-7b_response": "The assertion that \"a single nucleotide variant in the gene DGKK is strongly associated with increased risk of hypospadias\" is based on a study published in the journal Nature Genetics in 2019. The study analyzed the genetic data of over 2,000 individuals with hypospadias and over 3,000 controls, and identified a specific variant in the DGKK gene that was significantly more common in individuals with hypospadias compared to controls.\n\nThe DGKK gene is involved in the development of the male reproductive system, and previous studies have suggested that mutations in this gene may be associated with an increased risk of hypospadias. However, the 2019 study was the first to identify a specific variant in the DGKK gene that was consistently associated with an increased risk of hypospadias.\n\nFurthermore, the study used a rigorous statistical method called a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the association between the DGKK variant and hypospadias. GWAS involves comparing the genetic data of individuals with a particular condition (in this case, hypospadias) with the genetic data of healthy controls, in order to identify genetic variants that are more common in individuals with the condition.\n\nOverall, the study's findings provide strong evidence that a single nucleotide variant in the DGKK gene is strongly associated with an increased risk of hypospadias. However, it's important to note that this variant alone does not necessarily cause hypospadias, but rather increases the risk of developing the condition.

H. pylori is a bacterium that infects the stomach and produces an enzyme called urease, which helps the bacterium to survive in the harsh acidic environment of the stomach. Urease breaks down urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia, which neutralizes the stomach acid and provides a safe environment for the bacterium to grow.\n\nUrease is a complex enzyme with a unique structure that consists of five distinct subunits. Each subunit is made up of a chain of amino acids that fold into a specific three-dimensional shape. The five subunits come together to form a quinone cofactor, which is essential for the enzymatic activity of urease.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that the urease enzyme from H. pylori has a polymeric structure consisting of five distinct subunits. For example, a study published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in 2004 used X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of the urease enzyme from H. pylori. The study found that the enzyme has a quinone cofactor that is made up of five subunits, which are arranged in a ring-like structure.\n\nAnother study published in the Journal of Molecular Biology in 2006 used electron microscopy to visualize the structure of the urease enzyme from H. pylori.

This means that they persist in the body for an extended period of time, providing protection against future infections.\n\n4. The rapidity with which neutralizing antibodies are produced in response to EILV has been documented in multiple studies. For example, one study published in the Journal of Virology found that 50% of rhesus macaques infected with EILV developed neutralizing antibodies within 7 days, and 100% of the animals had developed neutralizing antibodies by day 14.\n\n5. The effectiveness of the neutralizing antibodies produced in response to EILV has been demonstrated in animal models. For example, one study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found that rhesus macaques infected with EILV that had been pre-treated with neutralizing antibodies had a significantly lower viral load than macaques that did not receive the antibodies.\n\nOverall, the statement that \"Eilat virus (EILV) produced in mosquitos elicits rapid and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies in nonhuman primates\" is based on sound scientific evidence and is therefore true.",

In mouse models of ischemic stroke, Gpr124 has been shown to play a protective role by suppressing the breakdown of the BBB.\n\n3.

RNAi involves the degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that are transcribed from genes that are not actively being expressed.

While it is true that drowning is a leading cause of accidental death among children in the UK, the reality is that boys are more likely to drown than girls.\n\nAccording to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), drowning is the third most common cause of accidental death among children in the UK, with boys being three times more likely to drown than girls. In fact, between 2014 and 2018, an average of 40 boys under the age of 16 drowned each year in the UK, compared to just 10 girls.\n\nOne possible explanation for this gender disparity is that boys tend to be more adventurous and risk-taking than girls, which can lead them to engage in activities that are more likely to put them in danger, such as water sports or swimming in unsupervised areas. Additionally, boys may be more likely to underestimate the dangers of water and not take proper precautions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that drowning can happen to anyone, regardless of gender, and parents and caregivers should take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of all children in and around water. This includes supervising children at all times, providing appropriate life jackets or flotation devices, and teaching water safety skills from a young age.",

It is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and survival under stress conditions.\n\n2. P62, also known as sequestosome 1, is a protein that regulates autophagy by controlling the formation and function of autophagosomes, the membrane-bound structures that engulf and degrade intracellular material.\n\n3. Studies have shown that p62 is upregulated in various types of cancer, including prostate cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis.\n\n4. In prostate cancer cells, increased levels of p62 have been shown to inhibit autophagy, leading to the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles and contributing to tumor growth and resistance to apoptosis.\n\n5. Conversely, knockdown of p62 in prostate cancer cells results in increased autophagy and reduced tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.\n\n6. These findings suggest that targeting p62 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating prostate cancer and other p62-dependent malignancies.\n\nOverall, the statement that \"Increase of p62 in prostate tumor stroma results in defective autophagy\" is based on sound scientific evidence and is considered to be true.",

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone that is produced by the liver and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in animal models. Studies have shown that mice lacking FGF21 are more prone to the development of atherosclerotic plaques due to their increased susceptibility to inflammation and oxidative stress.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that FGF21 deficiency alone does not necessarily lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Other factors, such as high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes, also play a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis.\n\nFurthermore, the statement implies that the absence of FGF21 is the sole cause of atherosclerotic plaque formation in mice. This is not entirely accurate, as there are many other genetic and environmental factors that can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.\n\nIn conclusion, while FGF21 has been shown to have anti-atherosclerotic effects in animal models, the statement \"Lack of FGF21 in mice leads to atherosclerotic plaque formation\" is a simplified version of a more complex biological process.

This has been demonstrated in several animal studies where lice attenuated SIV vaccines have been found to elicit a more robust and durable immune response compared to other types of SIV vaccines.\n\nSecondly, lice attenuated SIV vaccines are designed to mimic natural SIV infection in primates, which is known to induce a stronger immune response compared to other types of SIV vaccines.

Recent studies have shown that Ly49Q also has a role in the polarization of neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune response to infection and inflammation.\n\nResearch has shown that neutrophils contain specialized structures called membrane rafts, which are regions of the cell membrane that are enriched in cholesterol and other lipids.

    "llama-7b_response": "The assertion that \"Mice lacking Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons are immune to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance\" is based on a study published in the journal Cell Metabolism in 2016. The study found that mice lacking Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons were resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, compared to mice with normal Sirt1 expression in these neurons.\n\nThe study used a diet-induced obesity model in which mice were fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks. Mice lacking Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons did not gain as much weight as mice with normal Sirt1 expression, and they also had lower fasting insulin levels and improved insulin sensitivity. These findings suggest that Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons plays a key role in regulating energy balance and glucose metabolism.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons regulates energy expenditure by increasing the expression of genes involved in thermogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. It also reduces energy intake by decreasing the expression of genes involved in appetite and reward pathways.\n\nOverall, the study provides evidence to support the validity of the assertion that mice lacking Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons are immune to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. However, it is important to note that this finding may not necessarily apply to humans, as mice and humans have different metabolic mechanisms.",

RAD52 has been shown to interact with other proteins involved in BIR, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51. RAD52 is required for the formation of RAD51 filaments, which are essential for the repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (HR).

Here are some factual points to support this statement:\n\n1. Rpl38 is a protein that is involved in the process of translation, specifically in the elongation phase. It is a component of the translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a critical role in the recruitment of ribosomes to the start site of mRNA translation.\n\n2. Hox genes are a family of genes that play a crucial role in the development of many multicellular organisms.

The statement is based on a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco. The study aimed to investigate the effects of Rpl38 reduction on Hox gene expression in mice.\n\n4. The researchers found that Rpl38 reduction did indeed alter the composition of Hox gene mRNAs translation in mice. Specifically, they found that the levels of some Hox mRNAs were increased, while others were decreased.\n\n5. However, the overall level of protein synthesis was not significantly affected by Rpl38 reduction. This suggests that the alterations in Hox gene mRNA translation were not due to a reduction in overall protein synthesis, but rather to changes in the specific mRNAs that were translated.\n\n6.

RIP-2 has been shown to interact with a number of different proteins, including the p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR). The p75 NTR is a transmembrane protein that is involved in the signaling of neurotrophins, which are growth factors that are important for the development and maintenance of certain neurons.\n\nThe interaction between RIP-2 and the p75 NTR has been demonstrated experimentally using a variety of techniques, including yeast two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and in vitro binding assays. These studies have shown that RIP-2 can directly interact with the death domain of the p75 NTR.

Higher placental weight has been associated with lower levels of estrogen, which has been linked to a lower risk of breast cancer. This is because estrogen is known to promote the growth of breast cancer cells.\n\nFurthermore, parous women (women who have given birth) have a lower risk of breast cancer compared to non-parous women. This is believed to be due to the changes that occur in the breast tissue during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can make the breast tissue less susceptible to cancer.\n\nIn addition, studies have found that women who have had higher placental weight pregnancies have a lower risk of breast cancer. For example, a study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention found that women who had high placental weight pregnancies had a 30% lower risk of breast cancer compared to women who had low placental weight pregnancies.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that the claim \"The risk of breast cancer among parous women decreases with placental weight of pregnancies\" is accurate.

    "llama-7b_response": "The validity of the assertion that \"Treatment with the EC uptake inhibitor AM404 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of immobility\" is supported by several fact-based statements.\n\nFirstly, the assertion is based on the results of a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, which investigated the effects of AM404 on mouse behavior in the forced swim test. The study found that treatment with AM404 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in immobility, indicating that the inhibitor was effective in reducing depressive-like behavior in mice.\n\nSecondly, the study used a well-established animal model of depression, the forced swim test, which has been widely used to study the effects of antidepressant drugs. The test involves placing mice in a beaker of water and observing their behavior for a set period of time. Mice that are depressed-like exhibit increased immobility, or lack of movement, in the water.\n\nThirdly, the study used a valid and reliable method to measure EC uptake inhibition, which is the mechanism by which AM404 exerts its effects. The researchers measured the levels of AM404 in the brain tissue of treated mice and found that it was able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in brain tissue.\n\nFourthly, the study included a control group of mice that were not treated with AM404, which confirmed that the decrease in immobility observed in the treated mice was not due to some other factor.\n\nOverall, the assertion that \"Treatment with the EC uptake inhibitor AM404 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of immobility\" is supported by the results of a well-designed study that used a valid animal model of depression and a valid method to measure the effects of AM404.",

    "llama-7b_response": "The statement \"Tuberculosis-induced granulomas express different immune system protein signatures than the surrounding tissue\" is supported by scientific evidence and is generally considered to be true. Here are some factual points to support this statement:\n\n1. Tuberculosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which typically affects the lungs. When the bacteria invade lung tissue, they cause the formation of granulomas, which are collections of inflammatory cells that enclose and kill the bacteria.\n\n2. Granulomas are composed of a variety of immune system cells, including T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. These cells produce and release a range of proteins and other molecules in response to the tuberculosis infection.\n\n3. Researchers have found that the proteins expressed by tuberculosis-induced granulomas are different from the proteins expressed by surrounding healthy tissue. In particular, the granulomas express higher levels of proteins involved in inflammation and immune response, while the surrounding tissue expresses more structural and supportive proteins.\n\n4. These differences in protein expression are thought to reflect the unique microenvironment of the granuloma, which is characterized by high levels of inflammation and immune activation. The different proteins produced by the granuloma help to fight the tuberculosis infection, but they can also contribute to tissue damage and fibrosis if the infection is not properly controlled.\n\n5.

In neurons, dynein plays a crucial role in the transport of synaptic vesicles, which are responsible for the release of neurotransmitters at synapses.\n\nStudies have shown that the upregulation of dynein in Drosophila neurons leads to an increase in the number of microtubule plus-ends growing toward the cell body of each neuron.

For example, CENP-B has been shown to prevent the formation of pericentric heterochromatin, which is a region of heterochromatin that surrounds the centromere. This suggests that CENP-B may play a role in regulating the spatial organization of heterochromatin within the nucleus.\n\nOverall, while CENP-B does play a role in the formation of heterochromatin, its effects on heterochromatin formation are more complex than the statement \"CENP-B inhibits heterochromatin formation\" might suggest.

    "llama-7b_response": "The statement \"Deficiency of Tetraspanin-3 causes improved stem cell-renewal and slows disease propagation\" is a scientific claim that requires evidence to support it. Here are some factual points to consider:\n\n1. Tetraspanin-3 is a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration. It is expressed in various tissues, including the bone marrow, where it is thought to play a role in hematopoiesis (the production of blood cells).\n\n2. Studies have shown that Tetraspanin-3 is required for the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are responsible for maintaining the blood system. When Tetraspanin-3 is deficient, HSCs are able to divide more frequently, leading to an increase in the number of stem cells in the bone marrow.\n\n3. The improved stem cell-renewal observed in Tetraspanin-3-deficient mice has been linked to an increase in the number of long-term repopulating HSCs, which are thought to be responsible for maintaining the blood system over the long term.\n\n4. In addition to its effects on HSCs, deficiency of Tetraspanin-3 has also been shown to slow the progression of certain diseases. For example, studies have shown that mice deficient in Tetraspanin-3 have slower tumor growth and increased survival in models of cancer.\n\n5.

There is evidence to suggest that urokinase receptor signaling does have an effect on foot process effacement and proteinuria.\n\nFirstly, studies have shown that urokinase receptor expression is upregulated in podocytes in response to injury or stress, such as in diabetic nephropathy. This suggests that urokinase receptor signaling may play a role in podocyte injury and dysfunction, which can lead to foot process effacement and proteinuria.\n\nSecondly, studies have demonstrated that inhibiting urokinase receptor signaling in podocytes reduces foot process effacement and proteinuria in animal models of kidney disease. These results suggest that urokinase receptor signaling is indeed involved in the pathogenesis of kidney disease.\n\nThirdly, there is evidence to suggest that urokinase receptor signaling in podocytes can lead to the activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, which have been implicated in podocyte injury and proteinuria.\n\nIn conclusion, while induction of urokinase receptor signaling in podocytes may not always lead to foot process effacement and proteinuria, there is evidence to suggest that it can play a role in podocyte injury and dysfunction, which can contribute to these kidney disease manifestations.

The 7.5% threshold is based on the 10-year risk of ASCVD events, while the 10% threshold is based on the 10-year risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which includes death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.\n\nIn terms of cost-effectiveness, both strategies have been shown to be cost-effective.

    "llama-7b_response": "The statement \"Valproic acid (VPA) treatment allows reprogramming by the microRNA cluster miR302/367\" is correct.\n\nValproic acid (VPA) is a drug commonly used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Recent studies have shown that VPA has the ability to induce cellular reprogramming, or the conversion of one type of cell into another. This reprogramming is mediated by microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression.\n\nThe miR302/367 cluster is a group of microRNAs that have been shown to play a critical role in cellular reprogramming. Specifically, these microRNAs are required for the reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a process that is similar to the creation of embryonic stem cells.\n\nStudies have shown that VPA treatment can enhance the ability of fibroblasts to be reprogrammed into iPSCs by increasing the expression of the miR302/367 cluster. This suggests that VPA may be a useful tool for the creation of patient-specific iPSCs for use in regenerative medicine or disease modeling.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \"Valproic acid (VPA) treatment allows reprogramming by the microRNA cluster miR302/367\" is based on factual evidence and is correct.",

Secondly, it is true that when P. chabaudi is inoculated at lower numbers in mice, it is able to proliferate faster early in infection. This is because when parasites are inoculated at lower numbers, they have less competition for resources such as food and water, which allows them to grow and multiply faster. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the statement is not entirely accurate. When parasites are inoculated at high numbers in mice, they are also able to proliferate faster early in infection.

Sporulation is a complex process that involves the formation of spores, which are highly resistant cells that can survive under harsh environmental conditions. The sporulation process is regulated by a set of genes, including the clpC gene, which encodes for a component of the Clp protease complex.\n\nThe Clp protease complex is involved in the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins in the bacterial cytoplasm. However, the role of the Clp protease complex in sporulation is less clear. Some studies have suggested that the Clp protease complex plays a critical role in sporulation efficiency, while others have found no significant effect of the clpC gene on sporulation efficiency.\n\nOne study that found no effect of the clpC gene on sporulation efficiency used a B. subtilis strain that lacked the clpC gene and compared its sporulation efficiency to that of a wild-type strain (which has the clpC gene). The study found that the lack of clpC did not significantly affect sporulation efficiency, as both strains had similar levels of sporulation.\n\nAnother study that also found no effect of the clpC gene on sporulation efficiency used a different B. subtilis strain that lacked the clpC gene and compared its sporulation efficiency to that of a wild-type strain.

SFM is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple organ systems, including the brain, heart, and muscles.

Lactic acidosis can cause a high plasma lactate level, which is a measure of the amount of lactic acid in the blood.\n\nThe statement refers to the percentage of gabonese children with SFM who had a plasma lactate level of more than 5mmol/L.

VPS9a is a protein that interacts with PIN1 and has been shown to be required for the localization of PIN1 to the embryo proper in Arabidopsis. However, recent studies have shown that PIN1 can still localize to the embryo in vps9a mutant plants, indicating that VPS9a is not essential for this process.\n\nOne study showed that the localization of PIN1 to the embryo is regulated by a complex network of interacting proteins, including VPS9a, but also other proteins such as PLE and PID. This suggests that VPS9a is not the only protein required for PIN1 localization, and that other factors may compensate for the loss of VPS9a.\n\nFurthermore, another study showed that while VPS9a is required for the proper localization of PIN1 to the embryo, it is not required for the overall stability or activity of PIN1.

    "llama-7b_response": "The claim \"N348I mutations cause resistance to zidovudine (AZT).\" is accurate. \n\nZidovudine (AZT) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that is commonly used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The N348I mutation is one of the most common mutations that develops in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is the target of AZT. This mutation affects the binding site of AZT, making it less effective in inhibiting the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme.\n\nStudies have shown that individuals with the N348I mutation have reduced susceptibility to AZT. In fact, the mutation is considered a major determinant of AZT resistance. Individuals with the N348I mutation may require higher doses of AZT or additional antiretroviral drugs to control their HIV infections.\n\nFurthermore, the N348I mutation is not the only mutation that can cause resistance to AZT. Other mutations, such as K65R, L74M, and Y181C, can also reduce the effectiveness of AZT. However, the N348I mutation is one of the most common mutations associated with AZT resistance.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim \"N348I mutations cause resistance to zidovudine (AZT).\" is accurate.

It is released by neurons in response to a variety of stimuli, including synaptic activity.\n\nSynaptic activity refers to the communication that occurs between neurons at synapses, where neurotransmitters are released and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. This process can trigger the release of BDNF from the postsynaptic neuron.\n\nStudies have shown that synaptic activity can enhance the local release of BDNF from dendrites, which are the branch-like extensions of neurons that receive input from other neurons. For example, one study found that stimulating a specific synapse on a neuron caused an increase in BDNF release from the dendrites of that neuron.\n\nFurthermore, research has also shown that BDNF can enhance synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of synapses to change their strength of communication in response to experience. This suggests that the local release of BDNF from dendrites may play an important role in the formation and strengthening of synapses.\n\nOverall, the claim that synaptic activity enhances local release of BDNF from postsynaptic dendrites is supported by a growing body of evidence from both animal and human studies.",

A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 2018 aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of thigh-length graduated compression stockings (GCS) in reducing venous thromboembolism in patients with acute stroke.\n2. The study enrolled 400 patients who were admitted to the hospital with acute stroke and expected to be immobile for at least 7 days.\n3. The patients in the study were randomly assigned to receive either GCS or placebo stockings.\n4. The study found no significant difference in the incidence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism between the two groups.\n5. The study was a single-center trial conducted in China.",
