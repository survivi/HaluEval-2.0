Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

Amelia Sarah Levetus was a British suffragist and women's rights activist, but she did not have any known involvement in the study or promotion of cooperatives.\nThe origins and history of cooperatives as a business model can be traced back to the early 19th century, particularly in Europe and North America. The first modern cooperative, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, was established in 1844 in Rochdale, England. This cooperative was founded by a group of textile workers who pooled their resources to buy goods at wholesale prices and sell them at retail to their members.\nThe application of cooperative principles to business organization was a significant development in the history of cooperatives. This approach emphasized the importance of member ownership, democratic decision-making, and mutual aid in the success of cooperative enterprises. The Rochdale Principles, which were developed by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, became the foundation of modern cooperative principles and are still widely adopted by cooperatives today.\nOverall, while Amelia Sarah Levetus did not give a lecture on cooperatives at the University of Vienna in the late 19th century, the origins and history of cooperatives as a business model can be traced back to this time period and the pioneering efforts of cooperative movements in Europe and North America."
