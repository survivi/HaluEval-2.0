    "alpaca-7b_response": "Yes, you can accept gold as payment. The Coinage Act does not restrict the acceptance of foreign currency or lawful commodity or service to fulfill a debt. You are free to do that whenever you enter into an explicit or implicit contract with another party. If that wasn't the case, your kid trading his bag of chips for a bag of cookies at lunch would be a criminal act. It does mean that you ultimately must accept US currency to settle a debt. Following the previous example, if your kid gives his friend the bag of chips, but the cookies get destroyed somehow before being transferred, the friend can offer a couple of dollars to complete the transaction. The whole point of the Coinage Acts is to set a level playing field. If you don't pick one dominant store of value, you have a situation where it is impossible to evaluate the cost of goods and services. It has nothing to do with some competition with foreign currency. A robust, modern economy requires an adequate supply of capital and a common reference point for value within the economy."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "After a stock dividend, the holding period for capital gains taxes is determined by how long the investor has held the stock after the dividend is paid. If the investor has held the stock for more than one year, the gain is taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate. If the investor has held the stock for one year or less, the gain is taxed as ordinary income. \nIn the US, dividends are presently taxed at the same rates as capital gains, however selling stock could lead to less tax owed for the same amount of cash raised, because you are getting a return of basis or can elect to engage in a \"loss harvesting\" strategy. So to reply to the title question specifically, there are more tax \"benefits\" to selling stock to raise income versus receiving dividends. You have precise control of the realization of gains. However, the reason dividends (or dividend funds) are used for retirement income is for matching cash flow to expenses and preventing a liquidity crunch. One feature of retirement is that you're not working to earn a salary, yet you still have daily living expenses. Dividends are stable and more predictable than capital gains, and generate cash generally quarterly. While companies can reduce or suspend their dividend, you can generally budget for your portfolio to put a reliable amount of cash in your pocket on schedule. If you rely on selling shares quarterly for retirement living expenses, what would you have done (or how much of the total position would you have needed to sell) in order to eat during a decline in the market such as in 2007-2008?"

Tax certificates and regular saver accounts are two options that are available to help save money for taxation purposes. Tax certificates provide a clean way to segregate money and HMRC will treat the payment as if it was made at the time of purchase if it is later found that tax should have been paid earlier than it was.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "It is generally safer to send credit card numbers via unsecured website forms rather than by email. This is because unsecured website forms do not require any additional security measures, such as a secure connection or authentication, to protect the data being sent. Email, on the other hand, requires additional security measures to ensure the data remains secure. Additionally, unsecured website forms are designed to be more user-friendly and allow for faster data entry, making them a preferred method for sending credit card numbers. \nThere are several safer options for sending credit card numbers, however. One option is to use a secure website form that requires authentication and a secure connection. This provides an additional layer of security and ensures that the data remains protected. Another option is to use a virtual private network (VPN), which encrypts the data and routes it through a secure connection. This ensures that even if the data is intercepted in transit, it will remain secure and inaccessible to anyone but the intended recipient. \nOverall, it is generally safer to send credit card numbers via unsecured website forms rather than by email. However, if extra security is required, secure website forms, VPNs, or other secure methods should be used to ensure the data remains protected."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "You should be able to trade those funds.  I've never heard of a broker charging margin interest on unsettled funds, but that doesn't mean there isn't a broker somewhere that does. Brokers are allowed to impose their own restrictions, however, since margin is basically offering you a line of credit.  You should check to see if your broker has more restrictive rules.  If that's the case and you want to learn more about the rules generally, try searching for these terms: \"margin account\" and \"margin call\" and \"trading violations\" and \"margin interest\" and \"unsettled positions\".

Wells Fargo uses a service called clearXchange (update: it is now called Zelle) to facilitate person-to-person payments without an account number. This service is also used by Bank of America, so when a customer configures their account to be linked to clearXchange, both Wells Fargo and Bank of America customers can use it in the same way. \nIn addition, if a customer's bank is a member of clearXchange, they can use their current online or mobile banking service to send and receive payments without needing to register an account. If the customer had not previously configured it through BofA, they would have been taken to BofA's site to register an account in order to receive the money. \nIf a customer does not want to use this service anymore, they should contact their bank for assistance. If the bank cannot or will not help, the customer can contact clearXchange customer service to have their account closed."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "A 401(k) loan provision is a provision in a 401(k) plan that allows participants to borrow from their own retirement savings. This allows participants to access funds for certain purposes, such as buying a home or paying for college tuition, and repay the money to their 401(k) plan with interest. The interest rate is usually based on the prime rate, and the loan must be repaid within five years, or the money must be rolled over into another retirement account."

For example, if a call option is purchased at $10 and the stock rises to $20, the maximum profit is $10. However, if the stock rises to $50, the maximum profit is still $10, but the potential loss is now unlimited."

However, it is important to weigh the costs and benefits of adding PMI to your mortgage.

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The advice to pay off near-7% debt is tough to argue against. That said, I'd project out a few years to understand the home purchase. Will you plan for the 20% down John recommends? The Crazy Truth about PMI can't be ignored. The way the math works, if you put 15% down, the PMI costs you so much, it's nearly like paying 20% interest on that missing 5%. \nIf your answer is that you intend to save for the full downpayment, 20%, and can still knock off the student loan, by all means, go for it. I have to question the validity of \"\"we will definitely be in a higher tax bracket when we retire.\"\" By definition, pretax deposits save tax at the marginal rate. i.e. If you are in the 25% bracket, a $1000 deposit saves you $250 in tax that year. But, withdrawals come at your average rate, i.e. your tax bill divided by gross income. \nToday, a couple grossing $100K may be in the 25% bracket, but their average rate is 12%. \nI read this Q&A again and would add one more observation - Student Loans and Your First Mortgage is an article I wrote in response to a friend's similar question. With the OP having plan to buy a house, paying off the loan may be more costly in the long run. It may keep him from qualifying for the size mortgage he needs, or from having enough money to put 20% down, as I noted earlier. \nWith finance, there are very few issues that are simply black and white. It's important to understand all aspects of one's finances to make any decision. Even if thee faster payoff is the right thing, it's not a slam-dunk, the other points should be considered."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "Yield to maturity is the rate of return on a bond that an investor would receive if they held the bond until it matures. It is quoted as a percentage of the bond's face value and is based on the coupon rate and the current market value of the bond. The yield to maturity takes into account the coupon payments and the repayment of the face value at maturity, and is the best measure of the return of a bond. \nIn the case of a 10-year bond, the yield to maturity would be the same as the coupon rate, since the bond will be worth the same amount at maturity regardless of the current market value. However, for shorter-term bonds, the yield to maturity can be higher or lower than the coupon rate, depending on the current market value. \nThe upward slope of the yield curve is due to the fact that longer-term bonds have a higher yield than shorter-term bonds. This is because longer-term bonds are more risky than shorter-term bonds, so investors require a higher yield to compensate for the additional risk."

For example, if the daily interest rate is 1% and there are 30 days in the period, the interest charged would be 30 x 1% = 3.00%. \nIn the case of the given example, the interest rate is 0.7% and the number of days in the period is 28.8, so the interest charged would be (0.7% x 28.8) = 2.24%. \nThe formula for calculating the total payment by trial and error is: m = P * r^n * (r - 1) / (r^n - 1), where P is the original principle, r is the growth factor per payment period, i.e. interest rate, n is the number of payments, and (r - 1) / (r^n - 1) is the growth factor for the nth payment period. \nIn the given example, P = 500, r = 0.7%, n = 5, and (r - 1) / (r^n - 1) = 1.2016. \nThe formula gives m = 500 * 1.2016^5 * (1.2016 - 1) / (1.2016^5 - 1) = 167.78, which is close to the actual result of 168.32."

    "alpaca-7b_response": "The IRS allows you to claim a loss on a wash sale if you exit the position within the same day. In your example, you bought 100 shares of LMNO at $100, then after a large drop the same day, you sold all 10 shares at $90 for a loss of $1,000. Later in the afternoon, you bought another 100 shares at $92 and resold them an hour later at $97 (a $500 profit), closing out your position for the day. The second trade had a profit of $500, so you had a net loss of $500 (the $1,000 loss plus the $500 profit). Here’s how this works out tax-wise: The IRS first disallows the $1,000 loss and lets you show only a profit of $500 for the first trade (since it was a wash). But it lets you add the $1,000 loss to the basis of your replacement shares. So instead of spending $9,200 (100 shares times $92), for tax purposes, you spent $10,200 ($9,200 plus $1,000), which means that the second trade is what caused you to lose the $500 that you added back (100 x $97 = $9,700 minus the 100 x $102 = $10,200, netting $500 loss). On a net basis, you get to record your loss, it just gets recorded on the second trade. The basis addition lets you work off your wash-sale losses eventually, and in your case, on Day 3 you would recognize a $500 final net loss for tax purposes since you EXITED your position."

In fact, the call frequency increased   once they realized they had reached a   live person.\n5. I called each of these   companies multiple times, and though I   was given assurances each time that my   number would be taken off of their   lists, the calls continued, morning,   noon and night.\n6. At my wits end, I   decided the only way to have the   harassing calls stop was to file suits   against the collection companies.\n7. It's   very important to understand that it   is against the law for a company to   leave a pre-recorded message on your   cell phone.\n8. Armed with this knowledge,   I filed suit against several of the   collection companies.\n9. I filed in small   court so I did not need to hire   an attorney, and the process was as   simple as completing a paragraph on a   complaint form.\n10. For evidence, I had   over a hundred Google Voicemail   transcripts showing the times the   companies called and the text of the   pre-recorded messages.\n11. Mysteriously, the calls all stopped   immediately on the same date the   collection companies received the   certified letters stating they were   being sued.\n12. Then a new flurry of calls   began pouring in. This time it was   their attorneys.\n13. The attorneys representing these out   of state collection companies were all   desperate to settle out of court.\n14. They did not want to incur the expense of   traveling for court or hiring a local   law firm who wasn't on retainer.\n15. They also understood they had no   justifiable defense for the calls.\n16. To make a long story short, so far I have   successfully sued 3 of these   collection companies and settled for   more than $5,000 out of court.\n1"

This is because the authorized share capital is the amount of shares that the company has already planned on selling.

In order to do this, the company generally needs the approval of a majority of the existing shareholders. Therefore, the issuance of new shares does not reduce the value of existing shares."
