The law was enacted in 1986 and has been used to prosecute a variety of computer-related crimes, including hacking, identity theft, and cyberstalking.\nThe information provided in Document 0, Enmund v. Florida, suggests that the defendant in the case was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery, which suggests that the crime was committed in conjunction with another person. This could potentially make the defendant liable under the CFAA for conspiracy or aiding and abetting in the distribution of the computer worm.\nDocument 1 provides information on the rise in the not-employed rate among Americans aged 16 to 54, which could potentially be relevant to the case if the defendant was unable to find employment due to the consequences of the computer worm distribution.\nDocument 2 discusses the arguments for and against the death penalty, which are not directly relevant to the case at hand.\nDocument 3 highlights the issue of racial bias in the criminal justice system, which could potentially be relevant if the defendant is a member of a racial or ethnic minority group.\nDocument 4 discusses the impact of drug overdoses on individuals and society, which is not directly relevant to the case.\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, it is likely that the law broken by the American computer scientist born in 1965 was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) for the distribution of a computer worm.",

The organization was founded by 44 member countries that sought to build a framework for economic cooperation and stability in the aftermath of the Great Depression. The IMF is able to lend about $1 trillion to its member countries, and its purpose is to provide financial assistance to countries facing economic difficulties, as well as to promote international monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability.\nThe IMF was founded by British financier John Maynard Keynes, who is widely regarded as the \"father of modern philanthropy.\" Keynes was a prominent economist and policymaker who played a key role in shaping the post-World War II international economic order. He was a strong advocate for international cooperation and stability, and he saw the establishment of the IMF as a way to promote these goals.\nThe IMF was established at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, where delegates from 44 nations met to agree on a system of economic order and international cooperation. The conference was held in the aftermath of the Second World War, and the delegates sought to create a new international economic order that would promote stability and cooperation among nations.

The document also mentions that the United Kingdom is bordered by the English Channel and the Irish Sea, and that the highest summit in the UK is Ben Nevis, which is only 4,406 feet (1,343 meters) above sea level. Therefore, it is likely that the car featured in the advertisement is a British car with a relatively low elevation compared to other European equivalents.",

It is important to note that the pseudo-class only matches elements that are direct children of the parent element, and not any descendants of the parent element.\nTo use the `:last-child` pseudo-class, you can apply it to a selector that represents the group of sibling elements you want to target. For example, if you want to select the last `p` element in a div, you can use the following syntax:\n```css\ndiv :last-child p {\n  /* styles here */\n}\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `:last-child` pseudo-class in combination with other selectors to further narrow down the selection. For example:\n```css\ndiv > p:last-child {\n  /* styles here */\n}\n```\nIn this example, the pseudo-class is applied to the `p` element that is a direct child of the `div` element.\nIt is important to note that the `:last-child` pseudo-class only matches elements that are direct children of the parent element, and not any descendants of the parent element. This means that if you have a nested structure of elements, the pseudo-class will only match the last element in the innermost group of sibling elements.\nI hope this helps clarify how to use the `:last-child` pseudo-class in CSS. Let me know if you have any further questions!",
